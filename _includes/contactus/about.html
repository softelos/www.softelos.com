We come from different educational and professional backgrounds, but we share the same passion for web design, web development and software technologies in general. We used to live in Spain, where we worked for different industrial and technical companies designing and developing websites and complex web applications, but in 2008 we had the opportunity to travel to the US and visit Lynchburg for work related issues. 

I remember that once at the Washington Dulles airport, the immigration officer didn't even know where the city was, he even asked me surprised what I lost there that I needed to go. What we couldn't imagine at that moment is that we were going to fall in love with this city, its people, its way of life, and with the state of Virginia in general. Five years later we moved to Lynchburg and established it as our residency!

And here we are in 2014, with a new challenge that we just achieved starting our own agency to provide our passions as services to the local people of Lynchburg, Virginia and the United States in general. We are eager to make design and develop websites and web applications
