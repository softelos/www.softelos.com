				<p class="question"><strong><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-flip-horizontal"></i>What is with the name?</strong></p>
				<p>Softelos is the combination of the English word <strong>Software</strong> and the Greek word <strong>Telos</strong> (end or purpose of something). We are a team who loves web design, web development and software programming, and whose sole goal is to put these passions at your service to help your business to thrive through top-notch software based technologies.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question"><strong><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-flip-horizontal"></i>What industries do you work with?</strong></p>
				<p>We love all industries. We can work with a dentist, an insurance company, and a myriad of tech startups. Our perfect client is someone who loves great design, likes collaboration, and appreciates our creative input. We enjoy working with clients who understand the value of what we do and want to use design and software technologies to make their businesses more successful.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question"><strong><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-flip-horizontal"></i>What do you charge?</strong></p>
				<p>Our pricing is based on the amount of hours your project will take. In order to determine that, we will need to have a brief discussion about your project, the level of detail involved, technical requirements, etc. The best way to get the ball rolling on that process is to send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@softelos.com">hello@softelos.com</a>, and we’ll ask you some questions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question"><strong><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-flip-horizontal"></i>Why should I use Softelos to build my website when I could try and build it myself?</strong></p>
				<p>Building, designing and developing websites and complex online applications is what we do everyday. We’ve seen what works and what doesn’t work. Why re-invent the wheel when you can use our expertise to create your vision? Many of our clients are very creative, so we keep the space open for your unique input.</p>
			</li>			
			<li>
				<p class="question"><strong><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-flip-horizontal"></i>How long will it take you to complete my project?</strong></p>
				<p>Each timeline is different, and is determined by the amount of deliverables and the level of intricacy your project requires. Once we get more information about your project, we’ll be able to give you an estimated timeframe. The best way to start this process is to send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@softelos.com">hello@softelos.com</a>, and we’ll ask you some questions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question"><strong><i class="fa fa-comment-o fa-flip-horizontal"></i>Can I get my graphic designer to do the design?</strong></p>
				<p>Sure. Website design is quite a different style of design involving usability, visitor interactivity, browser and screen resolution limitations, and a whole host of other considerations. We recommend you make sure that your graphic designer is experienced with web design and has a grasp of what is required to meet the highly interactive demands of a web page design.</p>
