        <title>Fast and Secure Websites - Static Sites</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays many websites are built using a Content Management System or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; such as WordPress, Drupal or Joomla.  They allow the user to manage all their content through nice administrator control screens, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt;, or whatever server side technology the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; is built on, will magically and dynamically create the website pages every single time a visitor hits the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a website using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; is one of the many ways the Internet has become so powerful, since the old days when all websites were just a link or two and a flash banner. As a matter of fact, in 2015, 23.9% of the websites are made on WordPress, but using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; also involves having to deal with issues related to deployment, security, performance and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; is not the only way to create a website. Building them exclusively on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; static files is still one of the most efficient methods of creating fast and secure websites that still conform a big portion of the 60.4% that are not using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/staticvsdynamic.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Static vs Dynamic websites&quot; alt=&quot;Static vs Dynamic websites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a static &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; site?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A static site is a website made in such a way that its &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; content has already been pre-generated and is just laying out on the web server, as opposed to all the content being stored in a database waiting to be dynamically mashed together when a request comes by a server side technology like &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first heard about this concept we really wondered why would anyone want a static &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; site with the options we have today in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; products. However in many cases using a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; is over kill, not only technically wise, but also in terms of hosting and maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advantages of static &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; sites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt;.  Seconds can mean the difference between someone getting frustrated and leaving your website versus them staying and reading, buying, or clicking your ad.  With static &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, your site is ready and rearing to go because there is no database to query from or server side scripting to parse. Static websites are fast, superfast, since they are pure &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no database calls&lt;/strong&gt;.  No mashing together of content and templates, all that’s been done already.  &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; is what browsers read and they don&amp;#8217;t know &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt;, all they know is &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; markup, and it’s already there waiting for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt; is another thing static sites solve. When building websites we constantly need to watch for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; injection or other trickeries from the bad guys.  With static sites, the majority of the security issues go away since the site doesn’t have any database to inject &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; to. It’s just a set of read-only files sitting out on a file server. Where WordPress or other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; products have access (potentially write) to the database, they are inherently more hacker-prone than static files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;portability&lt;/strong&gt;.  With static websites there is no more &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; or Java requirements for the web server. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; is the most portable website technology of all time, because at the end of the day, it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; web technology, and can be moved from Apache to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt; to Nginx to whatever host environment we need and it&amp;#8217;s guaranteed it’ll work just as great as before we made the move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deployment&lt;/strong&gt;. Hosting only &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; files is very cheap since it doesn&amp;#8217;t require the servers to have other services installed and running. As a matter of fact, static &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; websites can be even hosted for free! Services such as GitHub provide this option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So should I use only static websites?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. A static website is a way of solving a specific problem, it&amp;#8217;s a tool that we need to make use when it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy for comparing static websites versus dynamic ones is whether the website could be printed out and still function properly. If the website will show information that is designed to be read, then we could print each page out, and with the exception of any hyperlinks we may have, it would still work. For projects like this the best option is to go with static websites due the advantages mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of this are landing pages, business pages like &lt;a href=&quot;http://softelos.com&quot;&gt;softelos.com&lt;/a&gt; (home, services, about, contact us), or blogs. At Softelos we are experts in static websites and we suggest them to our clients when they provide the best outcome for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if the website needs to be interactive and capable of being used by people who will use it not just for reading, the best option is to go with a dynamic website, built on a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; or custom web development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How we made softelos.com</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our website is no different from other web projects we develop for our customers. We follow the same procedures and apply the same principles when creating software for our own needs. Doing this allows us to be more critical with our methods and to spot possible issues to fix, or even to find better ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we describe the process we followed to make &lt;a href=&quot;http:\\softelos.com&quot;&gt;softelos.com&lt;/a&gt;. This will give an idea of how we approach and work on new projects in general from our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;.. discuss your needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first and most important stage of any web design or web development project we work on. During this stage we communicate with our customers to learn about their business, and to discuss their requirements for the project they have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a call or email to briefly introduce each other and to get a quick glimpse of what our customer needs, we usually meet in person for this stage if there are details that are not clear enough. Sometimes when the project is very complex, we might need more than one session in order to gather all the information we need to develop the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http:\\softelos.com&quot;&gt;softelos.com&lt;/a&gt;, the customer is us. We wanted a website that announces and promotes our business with the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We need a logo and branding (colors, fonts, and style).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The content has to summarize who we are, what we do, and our values. It shouldn&amp;#8217;t flood the visitor with unnecessary information and graphics.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The design has to be attractive and very light.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The design has to load fast.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The design has to support mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There should be at least the following clearly identified pages:
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Services&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Blog&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The home page will summarize the services we provide and our values.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The services page should provide more detailed information of the services we provide. It also should describe how we develop our projects.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The contact page should provide a simple contact form and most important frequently answered questions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The blog page will be used to periodically publish news, events and other interesting content from &lt;a href=&quot;http:\\softelos.com&quot;&gt;Softelos&lt;/a&gt;. It should list a teaser of all the articles we have sorted by categories. The title of each article should forward the visitor to the full article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the requirements are clearly defined, we review the time it&amp;#8217;ll take to complete the project and send an estimate to our customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;.. think of an unique idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start this stage when our customer accepts our estimate and places a purchase order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this stage we review all the requirements gathered during our communications with our customer, and we brainstorm amazing ways of implementing them in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this stage we also evaluate different possible technologies and pick the one that suits best to the project needs in the most efficient way. Many web agencies and web developers tend to use the same tool for all the projects they work on, making their final products to look all the same with very little innovation or flexibility. At &lt;a href=&quot;http:\\softelos.com&quot;&gt;Softelos&lt;/a&gt; we take a very different approach, we are experts in many different web design and software development technologies, which allows us to provide very imaginative solutions to the problems (when you have more than a hammer, not everything looks like a nail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http:\\softelos.com&quot;&gt;softelos.com&lt;/a&gt; we decided to go very simple and implement the website in pure &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, with no databases or server side scripting. This makes our website simple, light, fast, and very secure. However if the site was more complex, we would have probably gone with a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; such us WordPress or even Drupal if the project was really complicated and needed to handle thousands of users connected at the same time. And if our website required complex data processing, real time data process, or complex user-data interaction, we would have developed it from scratch with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; or node.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about pure &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; websites, read our article &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/advice/2015/03/16/fast-and-secure-websites-static-sites.html&quot;&gt;Fast and Secure Static Sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;.. design the concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when the fun starts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have defined the customer&amp;#8217;s requirements, selected a couple of design ideas, and chosen the right technology to use, we are able to turn all them into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we start creating a wire frame structure of the website or web application, with no graphics or real content. This helps us to show to our customer how the project is taking shape and also allows us to get feedback if something needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wire frame structure is like the framing of a house. It&amp;#8217;s functional, it allows the client to get an idea and make comments in case a room should be reallocated or more doors should be added on a wall. In the case of a website, the same principle applies, our customer will be able to test how all pages are connected together, how all the blocks of information are structured, the size of the design, the contact forms, etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/wireframe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the customer is happy with the wire frame structure and all his requests and changes have been applied, we proceed to apply the &amp;#8220;skin&amp;#8221; to the wire frame, which includes colors, pictures and real content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces the initial visual concept which we share with our customer for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/skin.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;.. you comment and we amend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this stage we communicate with our customer to discuss the initial visual concept and refine based on their feedback. Adding extra touches here and there just enhances the design for perfection. We usually allow two or three iterations of changes before closing the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;.. website development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the design has been completed and accepted by the customer, it&amp;#8217;s time to get the programming started, which is the heart or engine that makes everything to work. At this stage we start developing all the features and functionality of the website which at this point should have been already clarified with the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http:\\softelos.com&quot;&gt;softelos.com&lt;/a&gt;, although the website doesn&amp;#8217;t require any server side scripting (development), it still needs JavaScript code that makes possible some cool features such as the top header expanding and collapsing when scrolling the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;.. show it to the world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After intense testing and another round of feedback, we prepare to publish the master piece to the world. This is usually done by announcing the site as an email newsletter that we design and send to our client&amp;#8217;s customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case since our website is pure &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and JavaScript, we don&amp;#8217;t need an expensive hosting provider. We are using GitHub, a source version control site that offers free hosting for websites with no server side scripting or database support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
