We have launched Softelos, a small web design and development agency based in Lynchburg, right in the heart of Virginia. Softelos provides professional websites and cutting edge web applications for clients all over the United States.

We’re looking forward to working with many wonderful clients, and provide them the expertise we acquired as designers and software developers for different companies along the last years, so do not hesitate to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contactus">contact us</a> telling us about the project you have in mind, we will make it happen technically!.

We provide a fresh approach to web design and development. Our focus relies heavily on beautiful designs and implementations based on top notch web technologies. We’re always learning so that we can incorporate new technologies in our project as soon as they emerge. It’s a balance that we’ve perfected by our hunger for learning and our desire to achieve new challenges.

We also have a unique process approach that we apply to any project we work on, and which is based on rapid design and individual development phases. We care about long standing relationships, repeatedly delivery excellence, and building teams which extract the best in ourselves and brands we work with.

h3. The Website

We created <a href="http://softelos.com">softelos.com</a> taking a simple and clean design approach that works for anyone on any web-enabled device. Using responsive web design techniques, our site will respond and adapt according to the orientation of our visitor’s screen size and resolution. We also decided to make the website to load fast, so we used pure HTML with the help of the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> generator.

The website offers clear navigation to our visitors, making our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">homepage</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/whatwedo">services</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/notepad">blog</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contactus">contact</a> information easily accessible. Also our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/notepad">blog</a> (The Notepad) is easy, simple to navigate and read, and helps to position our website as a valuable asset to the community.

A simple yet powerful <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contactus">contact page</a> allows us to quickly respond to questions, requests or comments from our customers and friends.
