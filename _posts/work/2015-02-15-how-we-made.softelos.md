This document describes our process when creating websites.

<!--more-->

Our process is as follows:

# Discuss your needs

Firstly, we will find out what you require by listening to the bief and ensure we understand what is required. This is the key from the outset of all projects.

# This of a n unique idea

After we define the brief from the discussion stage, we can begin to think of ideas that will make your project unique. Remember your competitors are a click away!

# Design the concept

After the wireframes are devined and all funcitonality is planned, we are able to turn those ideas into visuals that will WOW you and your potential site visitors.

# You comment we ammend

We always find that it is best to discuss the initial visual concept and refine based on your feedback for the best results. Adding extra touches here and there just enhaces the design for perfection.

# Website development

Once all the designs have been finalized, it's time to get the programming started. At this stage all features and functionality would have been clarified. Our developers use this specification to build the site.

# Show it to the world

After intense testing and another round of feedback, we prepare to show the master piece to the world. This is usually done by announcing the site as a email newsletter that we design and send to your customers.
