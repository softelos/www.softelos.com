Our web site is no different from other web projects we develop for our customers. We follow the same values and apply the same principles when creating software for us.

This article describes how we did this with "www.softelos.com":http:\\www.softelos.com.

h3. .. discuss your needs

This is the first and most important stage of any web design or web development project we work on. During this stage we meet with our customers to learn about their business and needs, and to discuss their requirements for the web design or development. 

After a call to briefly introduce each other and to get a quick glimpse of what the customer needs, we usually meet in person for this stage. Sometimes when the project is very complex, we might need more than one session in order to gather all the information we need to develop the project.

In the case of Softelos, we are our own customers, and we needed a web site with the following requirements:

# The content has to summarize who we are, what we do and our values.
# The design has to be attractive but light.
# The design has to support mobile devices.
# The design has to load fast.
# The content doesn't flood the visitor with unnecessary information and graphics.
# A form that allows visitors to send inquiries.
# A blog where news, events and other interesting content can be published periodically to all visitors.

h3. .. think of an unique idea

In this stage we review all the requirements gathered during our meetings with our customer and brainstorm amazing ways of implementing them in a unique way. During this stage we also evaluate different possible technologies and pick the one that fits the project needs in the most efficient way. 

For www.softelos.com we decided to go very simple and implement the website in pure HTML, with no databases or server side scripting. This makes our website simple, light and very secure.

Many web design agencies use content management systems (CMS) for everything they do, no matter the size or requirements of the website or web development they are working on. Softelos takes a different approach, we are experts in many different web design and software development technologies, and we apply them when they make sense. 

See why we don't use Wordpress to learn more about our philosophy. 

h3. .. design the concept

This is when the fun starts!

Once we have defined the customer's requirements, selected a couple of design ideas and chosen the technology to use, we are able to turn all them into reality.

First we start creating a wire frame structure of the website or web development, with no graphics and real content. This helps us to show to our customer how the project is taking shape and also allows us to get feedback if something needs change.

Once the customer is happy with the wire frame structure and all his requests and changes have been applied, we proceed to apply the "skin" to the wire frame, which includes colors, pictures and real content. 

The initial visual concept is ready!

h3. .. you comment and we amend

During this stage we meet with our customer to discuss the initial visual concept and refine based on their feedback. Adding extra touches here and there just enhances the design for perfection.

h3. .. website development

Once all the designs have been completed, it's time to get the programming started. At this stage all features and functionality would have been clarified. Our developers use this specification to build the site.

Although www.softelos.com doesn't require any server side scripting (development), still needs JavaScript code that makes possible some cool features such as the top header expanding and collapsing when scrolling the browser. This is an example of what is implemented in this stage.

h3. .. show it to the world

After intense testing and another round of feedback, we prepare to publish the master piece to the world. This is usually done by announcing the site as an email newsletter that we design and send to your customers.

In our case since our site is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we don't need an expensive hosting provider. For Softelos we are using GitHub, a source version control site that offers free hosting for web sites with no server side scripting or database support.
